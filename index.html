					<h2>Design ✍️</h2>
						<h3>Figma</h3>
							<p>
							I really love design and for a few years now, I've been using <strong>Figma</strong>, a design tool. I have made a 25 pages Guide during my intership at
							<a href="https://www.legalstart.fr/" class="link-underline" target="_blank">Legalstart</a> and more recently the design of My Kitchen that you can find just below. I really enjoy design because it allows me to combine my <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>rigour</strong> to produce something aesthetically attractive.

						<h3>Canva</h3>
							<p>
							I am also very familiar with <strong>Canva</strong> that I use in my daily life either for my projets at school or to make some visuals for my association <a class="link-underline" href="https://www.facebook.com/iesegambassadeurslille" target="_blank">IÉSEG Ambassadeurs</a>.

					<h2>Cooking 🍲</h2>
					<p> 
					I have always enjoyed cooking, but even more so now that I live alone. As a student, I find it important to take time to prepare balanced meals. As a student, I think it's important to take time to prepare dishes. Health is about food and cooking allows me to express my <strong>creativity</strong>.

					<h2>Fashion 💃</h2>
					<p> 
					I have been passionate about fashion since I was a child, but I am increasingly turning to a new vision of clothing consumption. The clothing industry being the second most polluting, I think it is essential to promote <strong>second hand clothes</strong>.

					<h2>Association 👩‍🎓</h2>
					<p> 
					Since 3 years, I have been the president of IÉSEG Ambassadeurs, the association in charge of 
					<strong>promoting the school</strong> in high schools and through numerous events such as open days and student salons. 
					</p>
					<p>
					It is an association of <strong>11 people</strong> that is very close to my heart because I have seen it grow, I have spent hours working to improve it and make it known.
